Test methods

+ Initial Debug test

    1) Use a telnet client to connect to server. Type some requests in terminal and
    see if the response is expected and eyeball the server log.
    
    2) Run two routing daemons and check for any segfaults and error

+ Correctness test

    1) Use Chrome browser to view static '/'
    
    2) Use Chrome browser to run get object and add object. Check server/router log

    3) Run some simple configuration of nodes, eg 3-node ring, 3 nodes in a line

+ Memory leak test
           
    Run routing daemon with valgrind. Initial multiple GET/ADDFILE from brower.
    After a while kill siege and the server to see if there are **definitely lost**
    memory blocks.
                  
+ Evil test

    Kill and reboot some of the daemons to see if sequnece number is catched up, 
    and others correctly remove corresponding routing entry.

+ Stress test
                          
    1) Multiple browser and try get/add file requests.
    
    2) Run 5-node ring. Kill random nodes and see if next hop changes.
