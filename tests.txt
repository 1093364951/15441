# Test methods

+ Correctness test

    Use a telnet client to connect to server. Type some string in terminal and
    see if the echoed the string matches the input string.

    Run test script with reasonable parameters.

+ Memory leak test
           
    Run server with valgrind. Initial multiple connections with test script.
    After script exits, kill the server to see if there are **definitely lost**
    memory blocks.
                  
+ Evil test

    Initial multiple connections with test script. Kill the test script while
    it is still running. See if the server cleans up the closed sockets and
    buffers. Also use valgrind to make sure no memory leak in this case.

 + Stress test
                          
   Initial a huge amount of connections and trials with test scripts. Let the
   server runs for a long time (~10min). See how the server behaves under high
   load and check if test script still returns success.
